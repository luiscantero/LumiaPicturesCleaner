# LumiaPicturesCleaner

Taking pictures and making videos with Lumia Windows Phones may create lots of files that accompany the actual JPG or DNG files, e.g. *.tnl, *.mp4.thm, *.nar.

When deleting the unwanted pictures, the additional files need to be removed manually, which may not be an easy task.

This application for VS2015 scans a folder (including subfolders) and deletes all *.tnl and all orphaned *.mp4.thm, *.nar files.

WARNING: Use at your own risk.
