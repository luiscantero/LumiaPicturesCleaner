# LumiaPicturesCleaner
## Description
* Visual Studio 2015 C# application that scans a folder (including subfolders) and deletes all *.tnl and all orphaned *.mp4.thm, *.nar files.

## Motivation
* Taking pictures and making videos with Lumia Windows Phones may create lots of files that accompany the actual JPG or DNG files, e.g. *.tnl, *.mp4.thm, *.nar.
* When deleting the unwanted pictures, the additional files need to be removed manually, which may not be an easy task.

## WARNING
* Use at your own risk.
* Does not delete images or videos, only the above listed file types.
